# About Me
I (she/her/they/them) live and work as an uninvited settler on the unceded traditional territory of the Syilx Okanagan peoples. I am the Community Engagement and Open Education Librarian, as well as the subject liaison librarian for film studies, theatre, media studies, and the digital humanities at the University of British Columbia Okanagan (UBCO). My work includes connecting the wider community with UBCO Library resources and providing support to students, staff, and faculty working on open educational resources (OER), and building advocacy and awareness of OER at my institution. I am also a PhD student in Interdisciplinary Studies at UBCO, working under the supervision of Fiona P. McDonald (Anthropology) and Emily Christian Murphy (Digital Humanities). In 2019, I obtained my Master of Information Studies from McGill University. Prior to this degree, I earned an Honours B.A. in English and Gender, Sexuality, and Womenâ€™s Studies from Simon Fraser University. I also hold a diploma in Film Production from Capilano University. 

As a queer scholar, I am interested in reframing the way we observe and acknowledge queer histories in relation to and with feminist technologies.
